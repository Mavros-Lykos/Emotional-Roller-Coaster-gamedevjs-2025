## About the Game

"Emotional Roller Coaster" is a visual novel made with Ren'Py that explores the importance of emotional balance in life. You play as a university student navigating through daily events where every decision impacts your emotional state and life outcome. The key to winning is finding balance between extremes - neither too kind nor too cruel, neither too happy nor too sad.

## Game Mechanics

The game features 5 major events throughout a day in the protagonist's life, each with 5 different choices. Your choices affect your emotional stats across 5 key emotions:

1. **Kindness vs. Selfishness**
2. **Happiness vs. Sadness**
3. **Calmness vs. Anger**
4. **Generosity vs. Greed**
5. **Confidence vs. Fear**

Points are awarded as follows:
- Balanced/appropriate responses: +1 for positive emotions
- Extreme responses: +2 for either positive or negative emotions
- Neutral responses: 0 points

**Winning Condition**: To successfully navigate life, you must end with minimal positive emotion points (+1 or 0) and zero negative emotion points. Extreme emotions (even positive ones) lead to negative life outcomes.
